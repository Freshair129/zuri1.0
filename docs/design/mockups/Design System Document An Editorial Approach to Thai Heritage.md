# Design System Document: An Editorial Approach to Thai Heritage

## 1. Overview & Creative North Star
**Creative North Star: "The Modern Sovereign"**

This design system is not a mere collection of components; it is a digital expression of Thai prestige. It eschews the "templated" look of modern SaaS in favor of a **High-End Editorial** experience. We move beyond standard grids to embrace a "Sovereign Layout"—one that utilizes intentional asymmetry, generous white space (inspired by traditional Thai architectural "breathing room"), and a sophisticated tension between the technical precision of Deep Navy and the organic warmth of Saffron Gold.

The goal is to evoke the feeling of a luxury gallery or a high-end heritage publication. We achieve this by layering surfaces like fine stationery and treating typography as a primary design element rather than a secondary utility.

## 2. Colors: The Royal Thai Palette

The palette follows a strict **60-30-10 rule** to maintain a "Quiet Luxury" aesthetic. We avoid "pure" colors (pure #000 or #FFF) to ensure the interface feels natural and expensive.

### Neutral Foundation (60%)
- **Background (`surface` / `#f7fafd`):** A Cool White used for the primary canvas.
- **Surface (`surface_container_lowest` / `#ffffff`):** A Warm White used for primary content cards to create a subtle, "parchment-on-linen" contrast.

### Secondary Depth (30%)
- **Deep Navy (`secondary` / `#565e71`):** Used for sophisticated secondary elements and subtle structural anchors.
- **Off-Black (`on_surface` / `#181c1e`):** Our primary text color. It provides high contrast without the harshness of pure black.

### Accent & Soul (10%)
- **Saffron Gold (`primary` / `#795900`):** Reserved exclusively for high-intent CTAs and critical brand moments. It represents the "Royal" soul of the identity.

### The "No-Line" Rule
To maintain a premium feel, **1px solid borders for sectioning are strictly prohibited.** Boundaries must be defined solely through background color shifts. Use `surface_container_low` against a `surface` background to denote hierarchy.

### The "Glass & Gradient" Rule
Floating elements (modals, navigation bars) should utilize **Glassmorphism**. Apply `surface` at 80% opacity with a `20px` backdrop blur. For primary buttons, use a subtle linear gradient from `primary` (#795900) to `primary_container` (#d4a017) at a 135-degree angle to add "visual soul."

## 3. Typography: Editorial Authority

We use a dual-font strategy to balance heritage and utility. 

*   **Headings & Body (IBM Plex Sans Thai / Manrope):** IBM Plex Sans Thai provides a modern, high-legibility look with a subtle "Thai character" feel. It is used for all Display and Headline levels to establish authority.
*   **UI Labels (Prompt / Be Vietnam Pro):** Prompt is used for functional labels, buttons, and micro-copy. Its geometric nature provides a technical "UI" feel that contrasts beautifully with the editorial headings.

### Typography Scale & Rationale
- **Display (3.5rem - 2.25rem):** Use for hero moments. Apply a tighter letter-spacing (-0.02em) to create a bold, editorial impact.
- **Headline (2rem - 1.5rem):** Use for section starts. Always pair with generous top-padding (vertical white space) to mimic the "Sovereign" layout.
- **Body (1rem - 0.75rem):** Optimized for long-form reading. For Thai script, increase the default line-height to **1.6 or 1.8** to accommodate vowel and tone markers without crowding.
- **Labels (0.75rem - 0.6875rem):** All-caps for Prompt UI labels is encouraged for secondary buttons to increase the "Technical" contrast.

## 4. Elevation & Depth: Tonal Layering

Traditional shadows and borders create "visual noise." This design system uses **Tonal Layering** to create a sense of three-dimensional space.

- **The Layering Principle:** Think of the UI as sheets of stacked paper. 
    - Base: `surface` (#f7fafd)
    - Mid-ground: `surface_container_low` (#f1f4f7)
    - Foreground: `surface_container_lowest` (#ffffff)
- **Ambient Shadows:** Shadows should only be used on "Floating" elements (Modals/Dropdowns). Use an extra-diffused shadow: `box-shadow: 0 12px 40px rgba(16, 24, 40, 0.06);`. The shadow color is a tinted Navy, not grey.
- **Ghost Border Fallback:** If a border is required for accessibility, use the `outline_variant` (#d3c5ae) at **15% opacity**. This creates a "suggestion" of a line rather than a hard boundary.

---

## 5. Components

### Buttons
- **Primary:** Saffron Gold gradient. Roundedness: `md` (0.375rem). No border. Label: Prompt Bold, All-Caps.
- **Secondary:** Deep Navy (`secondary`). Ghost style (Transparent background with a `Ghost Border`).
- **Tertiary:** Text-only in `on_surface`. Underline on hover only.

### Cards & Content Blocks
- **Rule:** Forbid divider lines within cards.
- **Separation:** Use vertical spacing (e.g., `spacing-xl`) or a shift from `surface` to `surface_container_high` to distinguish between header and body content within a card.

### Input Fields
- **State:** Fields should be "Minimalist Editorial." Use a `surface_container_low` background with a bottom-only `outline_variant` border (2px) that turns `primary` (Gold) on focus.
- **Micro-copy:** Prompt Light for helper text, positioned with a 4px offset below the field.

### Heritage Component: The "Ornate Lead"
For article or section intros, use a larger-than-standard Display text with a 4px wide vertical Saffron Gold line to the left. This creates a high-end, curated feel that anchors the reader.

## 6. Do’s and Don’ts

### Do
- **Do** use asymmetrical layouts (e.g., a 2-column layout where one column is 60% and the other is 40%).
- **Do** use "Breathing Room." If you think there is enough margin, add 16px more.
- **Do** optimize for Thai characters by ensuring line-heights are significantly taller than Western defaults.

### Don’t
- **Don't** use 100% opaque borders to separate sections.
- **Don't** use "Alert Red" or "Success Green" at 100% saturation. Tint them to match the muted, Royal Thai palette.
- **Don't** use standard drop shadows. If it looks like a default Material Design shadow, it is wrong for this system.
- **Don't** crowd the corners. Maintain a minimum of `xl` (0.75rem) padding inside any container.```
