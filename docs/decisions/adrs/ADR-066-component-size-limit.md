# ADR-066: Component Size Limit — Max 500 LOC per Component

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

## Context

ZURI-v1 has accumulated massive, monolithic components that are increasingly difficult to maintain. Current offenders:

- `PremiumPOS.js`: 2,400 LOC — cart, payment, receipt, and floor plan all in one file
- `EmployeeManagement.js`: 2,000 LOC — CRUD, roles, search, and bulk operations combined
- `FacebookAds.js`: 2,000 LOC — dashboard, charts, filters, and sync status in one file
- `FacebookChat.js`: 1,800 LOC — inbox, chat, reply, customer card, and quick sale combined
- `TaskPanel.js`: 1,200 LOC

These large components cause several compounding problems:

- **Slow renders** — React re-renders the entire component tree on any state change
- **Hard to test** — unit tests require mocking the full component surface
- **Merge conflicts** — multiple developers editing the same large file
- **AI agent context loss** — when Claude Code reads a 2,400 LOC file, it cannot hold the full context in working memory, increasing hallucination risk and reducing edit quality

The root cause is absent enforcement: no rule, no tooling, and no convention existed to prevent unbounded growth.

## Decision

- **Hard limit: 500 LOC per React component file**
- **Soft limit: 300 LOC preferred** — aim for single-responsibility components

### Split Strategy

**Extract sub-components** — decompose by UI region or logical concern:
- `PremiumPOS` → `CartPanel` + `PaymentPanel` + `ReceiptPreview` + `FloorPlan`
- `EmployeeManagement` → `EmployeeList` + `EmployeeForm` + `RoleAssignment` + `BulkOpsToolbar`
- `FacebookAds` → `AdsOverviewDashboard` + `AdsChartPanel` + `AdsFilterBar` + `AdsSyncStatus` + `AdsCampaignTable`
- `FacebookChat` → `InboxList` + `ChatThread` + `ReplyComposer` + `CustomerCard` + `QuickSalePanel`

**Extract custom hooks** — isolate stateful logic:
- `useCart()`, `usePayment()`, `useFloorPlan()`

**Extract utilities** — pure functions with no side effects:
- `formatCurrency()`, `calculateDiscount()`

### Limits by File Type

| File Type | Hard Limit | Soft Limit |
|---|---|---|
| React component (.jsx/.js) | 500 LOC | 300 LOC |
| Custom hook (use*.js) | 200 LOC | 150 LOC |
| Utility file | 150 LOC | 100 LOC |
| API route handler | 100 LOC | 60 LOC (delegate to repo/service) |

### Measurement

Count lines excluding blank lines and comments. Use `wc -l` as a rough proxy during enforcement.

### Pre-Commit Enforcement

A pre-commit hook warns when any `.jsx` or `.js` component file staged for commit exceeds 500 LOC. Warning threshold only — not blocking. Boss makes the final call on exceptions.

### Splitting Guide for ZURI-v1 Backlog

| Component | Current LOC | Target Components | Target Hooks |
|---|---|---|---|
| PremiumPOS | 2,400 | 6 | 3 |
| EmployeeManagement | 2,000 | 4 | 2 |
| FacebookAds | 2,000 | 5 | 2 |
| FacebookChat | 1,800 | 5 | 3 (partially split) |

## Alternatives Considered

1. **No limit (current ZURI-v1 state)** — painful to maintain, AI agents struggle, rejected.
2. **1,000 LOC limit** — still too large for AI agent context windows; does not solve the core problem.
3. **Enforce via ESLint rule** — too strict; blocks development mid-feature and discourages incremental progress. A warning-based pre-commit hook is more pragmatic.
4. **100 LOC micro-components** — over-engineering; creates excessive context switching between dozens of small files. The 300 LOC soft limit guards against this.

## Consequences

### Positive

- AI agents (Claude Code) can hold the full component in working memory → higher edit quality, fewer hallucinations
- Easier unit and integration testing — smaller surface per file
- Smaller, more focused PRs → faster code review
- Parallel development — multiple developers can work on related features without merge conflicts
- Encourages the repository pattern and hook extraction already mandated by CLAUDE.md

### Negative

- More files to manage — `src/components/pos/` may contain 6 files where `PremiumPOS.js` was one
- Some context switching required when tracing a full feature across sub-components
- Initial refactor effort for ZURI-v1 legacy components (tracked in RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md)

### Risks

- **Over-splitting into micro-components** — mitigated by the 300 LOC soft limit (not 100) and the principle of single-responsibility, not single-function
- **Artificial splitting to pass the lint check** — mitigated by code review; the goal is cohesive sub-components, not arbitrary line cuts
- **Pre-commit hook ignored or bypassed** — mitigated by making it a warning (not a block), reducing incentive to skip with `--no-verify`

## Implementation Notes

- Pre-commit script: `.dev/orchestrator/commands/pre-commit.js`
  - Scans staged `.jsx` and `.js` files for LOC count
  - Logs a warning (yellow) when a file exceeds 500 LOC
  - Does not block the commit — Boss reviews flagged files in PR
- Warning threshold: **500 LOC**
- Blocking threshold: **none for now** — soft enforcement via code review
- Refactor work for ZURI-v1 legacy components is tracked separately in `RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`
