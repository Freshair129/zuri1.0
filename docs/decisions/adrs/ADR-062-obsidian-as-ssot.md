# ADR-062: Obsidian as Single Source of Truth for Documentation

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

---

## Context

ZURI-v1 documentation is fragmented across multiple locations:

- Root-level markdown files (15+): `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT_PROTOCOL.md`, `RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`, etc.
- `docs/adr/` — 33 ADR files in a flat structure
- `docs/zuri/` — 11 product/feature docs with inconsistent naming
- Google Docs and Notion pages (external, not version-controlled)

This fragmentation creates concrete problems:
- **Discoverability:** Developers grep the filesystem or ask Claude to find a doc — no central index
- **Staleness:** Docs update in isolation; cross-references break silently
- **No linking:** A spec cannot link to its ADR; a gotcha cannot link to the incident it came from
- **AI agent access:** Claude Code has no consistent, structured path to read/write docs programmatically
- **Onboarding cost:** New team members have no map of what docs exist or where to start

The project now runs Claude Code as an AI agent via MCP. For the agent to be a reliable collaborator, it needs a predictable, queryable document store — not a scattered filesystem.

## Decision

The `docs/` directory at the repository root **is** the Obsidian vault. There is no copy and no sync process — Obsidian reads and writes directly to `docs/`, and git tracks every change.

Key commitments:

- **Vault path:** `E:\zuri\docs\`
- **MCP access:** Claude Code reads/writes via `obsidian-local-rest-api` plugin (port 27124, HTTPS) — tools prefixed `mcp__obsidian__*`
- **Git tracking:** All `.obsidian/` config committed to git (shared graph settings, color-coding, templates). Exception: `workspace.json` goes to `.gitignore` if merge conflicts become frequent.
- **Entry point:** `docs/HOME.md` serves as the vault index with wikilinks to all sections
- **Canonical structure:**

  ```
  docs/
  ├── HOME.md                         # Vault entry point
  ├── product/
  │   ├── PRD.md                      # Product requirements v2.2
  │   ├── ROADMAP.md                  # Milestones M1–M7
  │   └── specs/                      # FEAT-*.md approved specs
  ├── architecture/
  │   ├── ERD.md
  │   ├── data-flows/
  │   └── tech-spec.md
  ├── decisions/
  │   ├── adrs/                       # ADR-*.md files (this file lives here)
  │   └── log.md                      # Decision history
  ├── gotchas/                        # Incident rules — read before unsure
  ├── guide/                          # Dev guides, onboarding
  ├── devlog/                         # YYYY-MM-DD.md daily logs
  └── templates/                      # Feature spec, ADR, devlog templates
  ```

- **Graph view color-coding** (`.obsidian/graph.json`):
  - Blue — `product/specs/`
  - Orange — `architecture/`
  - Red — `gotchas/`
  - Purple — `decisions/`
  - Green — `architecture/data-flows/`

- **Templates** for: feature spec (`FEAT-template.md`), ADR (`ADR-template.md`), devlog (`devlog-template.md`)

Claude Code rule (already in `CLAUDE.md`): if context is lost, query Obsidian via MCP before asking Boss.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|
| **Notion** | No git integration, no offline access, MCP read-only and limited, docs diverge from code |
| **Confluence** | Paid, no git integration, no local file access for AI agents |
| **Plain markdown without Obsidian** | No graph view, no wikilink resolution, no templates, no MCP — just files |
| **Separate `docs` repo** | Loses co-location with code; ADRs and specs drift out of sync with the implementation they describe |
| **Obsidian Sync (cloud)** | Adds cost and a second source of truth; git already handles versioning |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Single truth:** Every doc lives in one place, co-located with code, versioned in git
- **AI-readable via MCP:** Claude can query, read, and append to any doc without file path guessing
- **Knowledge graph:** Wikilinks surface relationships (spec → ADR → gotcha) that flat files cannot express
- **Git history:** Doc evolution is tracked alongside the code changes that prompted it
- **Graph view:** Obsidian's canvas shows architectural relationships visually — useful for onboarding and planning sessions
- **Templates enforce consistency:** New specs and ADRs start from a known shape

### Negative

- **Obsidian required for best experience:** Team members who prefer Word or Google Docs lose formatting/review features; plain text editing still works but loses graph/link features
- **`.obsidian/` in git:** Adds 10+ config files. Minor noise, but some editors flag them as clutter.
- **MCP server must be running:** `obsidian-local-rest-api` must be active locally for Claude's MCP tools to work; fallback is direct file system reads

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Merge conflicts on `.obsidian/workspace.json` | Medium | Add `workspace.json` to `.gitignore` |
| MCP server not running blocks agent reads | Low | Claude falls back to filesystem reads via Read tool |
| Docs written outside Obsidian skip wikilink validation | Medium | PR template checklist: "Did you update HOME.md links?" |

## Implementation Notes

1. Confirm `.obsidian/` config is committed: `graph.json`, `app.json`, `templates/` plugin config
2. Add `docs/HOME.md` as vault index if not present
3. Add `docs/.obsidian/workspace.json` to `.gitignore`
4. Configure `obsidian-local-rest-api` on port 27124 in Obsidian settings
5. Migrate existing ADRs from `docs/adr/` → `docs/decisions/adrs/` (already in progress per this file's location)
6. Migrate `docs/zuri/` feature docs → `docs/product/specs/` with `FEAT-` prefix
7. Update `CLAUDE.md` File Reference section to reflect canonical vault paths
8. Daily devlog path: `docs/devlog/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
