# ADR-060: Modular Architecture — Core/Shared/Industry Split

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

---

## Context

ZURI-v1 is a flat monolith with no module boundaries:

- **341 files** all colocated under `src/` with no enforced separation
- **Giant components:** PremiumPOS (~2,400 LOC), EmployeeManagement (~2,000 LOC), Analytics (~2,000 LOC)
- **81 Prisma models** in a single `schema.prisma` file (95KB) — impossible to review, impossible to own per team
- Culinary-specific logic (Recipe, Ingredient, CourseMenu, enrollment workflows) is tightly coupled to core business logic (CRM, POS, Inbox)
- Swapping the industry layer (e.g., adapting for a beauty school or fitness studio) would require rewriting core — there is no seam between "always-on platform" and "vertical-specific features"
- A single developer (or agent) working across the codebase has no natural unit of work — every change is cross-cutting

The migration to a modular architecture is defined in `RESTRUCTURE_PLAN.md`.

## Decision

Split the codebase into a three-tier module structure under `src/modules/`:

```
src/modules/
  core/           # Every industry uses these — 8 modules
    auth/
    crm/
    inbox/
    pos/
    marketing/
    dsb/
    tasks/
    notifications/
  shared/         # Cross-industry but optional — 3 modules
    procurement/
    inventory/
    audit/
  industry/       # Vertical-specific, loaded per tenant config
    culinary/     # V School: enrollment, kitchen, certificates
```

**Module structure contract** — every module must contain:

```
{module}/
  components/   # React components, max 500 LOC each (enforced — see ADR-066)
  api/          # Next.js route handlers for this module
  repo.js       # All DB access (no getPrisma() outside repos — CLAUDE.md rule)
  hooks.js      # React hooks for this module
  constants.js  # Module-level constants (no magic numbers)
  index.js      # Public manifest — defines all exports for this module
```

**Import discipline:**

- Cross-module imports are only permitted through the module's `index.js` manifest
- Direct imports from another module's internal files (e.g., `import X from '../crm/components/CustomerCard'`) are forbidden
- Industry modules may depend on `core/` and `shared/` modules, but never the reverse
- `core/` modules must not import from `industry/` modules

**Industry loading:**

- The active industry module is determined by `tenant.industry_module` in the tenant config (resolved by `src/middleware.js`)
- Default for all existing tenants: `culinary`
- Future industries (beauty, fitness) add a new folder under `industry/` without touching `core/`

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|
| **Microservices** | Requires separate deployments, databases, and inter-service communication. Overkill for a 1-person team on Vercel serverless. Operational complexity far exceeds benefit at current scale. |
| **Feature folders** (flat `src/features/`) | Provides co-location but no industry isolation. Culinary code would still be coupled to core; impossible to swap verticals. |
| **Monorepo with npm packages** | Correct long-term direction but premature — requires build tooling (Turborepo/Nx), versioning, and publishing overhead. Can be adopted once module boundaries are stable. |
| **Keep monolith** | Current pain continues: no PR reviewability on schema, 2K+ LOC components, no seam for industry swap. |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Each module can be developed, reviewed, and tested independently
- Industry layer is swappable per tenant — path to multi-vertical SaaS
- 500 LOC component limit (ADR-066) is enforceable because module boundaries are explicit
- New team members or AI agents can be assigned a single module without understanding the whole codebase
- Schema can be split per module (ADR-061) once folder structure is in place
- `repo.js` per module makes it easy to audit all DB access for a given domain

### Negative

- More files and directories — the raw file count will increase significantly during migration
- Cross-module imports require discipline; a linter rule (eslint-plugin-import boundaries) is needed to enforce the manifest-only rule
- Initial migration effort is high: 341 files must be moved and re-imported
- Developers must learn which module owns which domain before adding new code

### Risks

- **Dependency cycles:** If `core/crm` imports from `core/pos` and `core/pos` imports from `core/crm`, the manifest boundary breaks down. Mitigation: add `eslint-plugin-boundaries` to CI from day one.
- **Big-bang migration:** Moving all 341 files at once is risky. Mitigation: migrate module-by-module, keeping `src/` flat files as-is until their module is ready (strangler fig pattern).
- **Over-engineering shared/:** Shared modules may become a dumping ground. Rule: if a module is only used by `culinary/`, it belongs in `industry/culinary/`, not `shared/`.

## Implementation Notes

**Phase 1 — Scaffold (no code moves yet):**

```bash
mkdir -p src/modules/core/{auth,crm,inbox,pos,marketing,dsb,tasks,notifications}
mkdir -p src/modules/shared/{procurement,inventory,audit}
mkdir -p src/modules/industry/culinary
# Create empty index.js in each
```

**Phase 2 — Migrate module-by-module (start with lowest coupling):**

1. `core/notifications` — least coupled, good warm-up
2. `core/tasks`
3. `industry/culinary` — move Recipe, Ingredient, CourseMenu, Enrollment
4. `core/crm`, `core/inbox`, `core/pos`, `core/marketing`, `core/dsb`
5. `shared/` modules last

**Phase 3 — Enforce boundaries:**

```json
// .eslintrc — add after migration complete
{
  "plugins": ["boundaries"],
  "rules": {
    "boundaries/no-unknown": "error",
    "boundaries/element-types": ["error", {
      "default": "disallow",
      "rules": [
        { "from": "industry", "allow": ["core", "shared"] },
        { "from": "shared",   "allow": ["core"] },
        { "from": "core",     "allow": ["core"] }
      ]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Key file paths after migration:**

- `src/modules/core/crm/repo.js` — replaces scattered CRM `getPrisma()` calls
- `src/modules/core/inbox/index.js` — public API for Inbox module
- `src/modules/industry/culinary/index.js` — culinary feature manifest
- `src/middleware.js` — add `tenant.industry_module` resolution
