# ADR-065: Industry Plugin System — Tenant-Configured Module Loading

**Status:** PROPOSED

## Context

Zuri targets culinary schools (V School) as its first market, but the product vision is a Vertical SaaS platform that can serve any food business — and eventually adjacent industries (beauty schools, fitness studios).

ZURI-v1 hardcodes culinary concepts directly into core platform code:

- `Recipe`, `Ingredient`, `CourseMenu`, `CourseSchedule` models live alongside `Customer`, `Order`, `Employee` in a single flat schema
- `/kitchen`, `/schedule`, `/recipes`, `/enrollment` pages are co-located with `/crm`, `/pos`, `/inbox` with no module boundary
- Culinary business logic (e.g., enrollment triggered on course order, prep sheet generation from recipe) is embedded in POS and CRM handlers
- To serve a beauty school, you would need to remove or hide all culinary concepts — there is no seam

ADR-060 established the three-tier module structure (`core/`, `shared/`, `industry/`). This ADR defines how the `industry/` tier works at runtime: how a tenant's configured industry determines which plugin loads, what the plugin manifest contract is, and how core modules remain fully decoupled from industry-specific code.

## Decision

**Industry-specific features live in `src/modules/industry/{industry_name}/` and are loaded per tenant based on `tenant.industry` config.**

### Plugin Manifest Contract

Every industry plugin exposes an `index.js` manifest with the following shape:

```js
// src/modules/industry/culinary/index.js
export default {
  name: 'culinary',

  // Prisma model names owned by this plugin (informational — not runtime loaded)
  models: [
    'Recipe', 'Ingredient', 'IngredientLot', 'IngredientCategory',
    'CourseSchedule', 'CourseScheduleItem', 'Enrollment',
    'Package', 'Certificate', 'AttendanceRecord',
    'PrepSheet', 'KitchenStation', 'DishPhoto'
  ],

  // Next.js App Router paths registered by this plugin
  pages: ['/kitchen', '/schedule', '/recipes', '/enrollment'],

  // Core platform events this plugin subscribes to
  hooks: {
    'order.created': handleEnrollment,
    'order.cancelled': handleEnrollmentCancellation,
    'shift.started': generatePrepSheets,
  },

  // Navigation items injected into the core sidebar
  navigation: [
    { label: 'Kitchen',    icon: 'ChefHat',   path: '/kitchen',    roles: ['MGR', 'STF'] },
    { label: 'Schedule',   icon: 'Calendar',  path: '/schedule',   roles: ['MGR', 'TEC'] },
    { label: 'Recipes',    icon: 'BookOpen',  path: '/recipes',    roles: ['MGR', 'PD']  },
    { label: 'Enrollment', icon: 'GraduationCap', path: '/enrollment', roles: ['MGR', 'SLS'] },
  ],
}
```

### Tenant Configuration

The `Tenant` model gains an `industry` field:

```prisma
model Tenant {
  // ... existing fields
  industry  String  @default("culinary")  // "culinary" | "beauty" | "fitness"
}
```

Middleware resolves the active industry plugin on every request:

```js
// src/middleware.js
const tenant = await getTenant(tenantId)
const plugin = await loadIndustryPlugin(tenant.industry)  // dynamic import
headers.set('x-industry-plugin', tenant.industry)
```

### Core Module Rules

- `core/` modules must contain **zero imports** from `industry/` modules
- `core/` modules emit named events via a lightweight event bus (`src/lib/events.js`) — industry plugins subscribe
- Core sidebar reads `plugin.navigation[]` at runtime to render industry nav items — it does not hardcode any industry routes
- Core API routes do not reference industry models directly — industry plugins register their own API routes under `src/modules/industry/{name}/api/`

### Plugin Loading

Industry plugins are loaded via dynamic import, resolved at request time from the tenant config:

```js
// src/lib/industryPlugin.js
export async function loadIndustryPlugin(industryName) {
  const plugin = await import(`../modules/industry/${industryName}/index.js`)
  return plugin.default
}
```

### MVP Scope

For MVP, only the `culinary` plugin exists. The plugin system is designed for future verticals but no beauty or fitness plugin will be built until a second paying customer in a different vertical is confirmed.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|
| **Feature flags per tenant** | Flags scale to O(features × tenants). Toggling culinary features off for a beauty school means adding and maintaining a flag for every culinary component, route, and DB query. Does not handle fundamentally different data models (a beauty school has `Treatment`, not `Recipe`). |
| **Separate codebases per industry** | Defeats the purpose of a SaaS platform. Bug fixes and core feature improvements must be deployed N times. Not viable beyond 2 industries. |
| **All features always on, hide via RBAC** | Core codebase becomes bloated with all vertical logic. A beauty school tenant sees (and pays for) culinary models in their schema. Confusing UX, confusing schema, impossible to market as purpose-built. |
| **Monorepo packages per industry** | Correct long-term direction. Premature now — requires Turborepo/Nx, versioning, and a more mature module API. Can be adopted once plugin interface is stable across 2+ industries. |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Core platform (`core/`, `shared/`) is clean — no culinary imports, no industry-specific logic
- Adding a new vertical = adding a new folder under `industry/` and implementing the manifest contract — no core changes required
- `tenant.industry` config drives all behavior — the same deployment serves all industries
- Industry plugin navigation injects cleanly into the core sidebar — no sidebar hardcoding
- Culinary plugin's 20 models are clearly owned and isolated — schema review is scoped to `industry/culinary/`
- Future AI agents can be assigned "work on the culinary plugin" as a self-contained unit of work

### Negative

- Abstraction overhead: core must emit events rather than calling industry logic directly — adds indirection
- Core sidebar, middleware, and event bus must be designed with the plugin API in mind from the start
- Plugin manifest contract must be versioned — if the contract changes, all existing plugins must be updated
- `core/` developers must resist the temptation to import industry types for "convenience"

### Risks

- **Over-abstraction too early:** Building a sophisticated plugin registry before a second vertical customer exists is speculative engineering. Mitigation: keep the plugin interface minimal (manifest + hooks + navigation); do not build a plugin marketplace or hot-reload system until needed.
- **Event bus reliability:** If core emits `order.created` and the culinary plugin's `handleEnrollment` throws, the order is still committed but enrollment is not created. Mitigation: hooks run in a QStash worker (async), not in the API route — failures retry independently.
- **Prisma schema coupling:** Even though code is decoupled, all industry models still live in the same PostgreSQL database and `schema.prisma`. A culinary model name collision with a future fitness model is possible. Mitigation: namespace model names by industry (e.g., `CulinaryRecipe` if needed), or use ADR-061 (schema split) to give each industry plugin its own schema file.

## Implementation Notes

**Directory structure for culinary plugin:**

```
src/modules/industry/culinary/
  index.js                  # Plugin manifest (models, pages, hooks, navigation)
  api/
    kitchen/route.js        # /api/kitchen/* handlers
    schedule/route.js       # /api/schedule/* handlers
    recipes/route.js        # /api/recipes/* handlers
    enrollment/route.js     # /api/enrollment/* handlers
  components/
    PrepSheet.jsx
    AttendanceSheet.jsx
    RecipeCard.jsx
    CourseScheduleGrid.jsx
  repo.js                   # All DB access for culinary models
  hooks.js                  # React hooks (useRecipes, useEnrollment, etc.)
  constants.js              # Culinary-specific constants
```

**Tenant model migration:**

```prisma
// Add to Tenant model in prisma/schema.prisma
industry  String  @default("culinary")
```

**Event bus (lightweight):**

```js
// src/lib/events.js — emit/subscribe pattern
// Core emits: order.created, order.cancelled, shift.started
// Industry plugins subscribe in their index.js hooks map
```

**Core sidebar integration:**

```jsx
// src/modules/core/components/Sidebar.jsx
import { loadIndustryPlugin } from '@/lib/industryPlugin'
// Render plugin.navigation[] items after core nav items
// Filter by user roles using can() from permissionMatrix.js
```

**Rollout order:**

1. Add `industry` field to Tenant model (default: `"culinary"`) — no behavior change
2. Create `src/modules/industry/culinary/index.js` manifest — static, no behavior change
3. Migrate culinary pages and components into `industry/culinary/` (strangler fig)
4. Wire middleware to load plugin manifest
5. Update core sidebar to read `plugin.navigation[]`
6. Add event bus; migrate culinary hooks (enrollment on order, prep sheets on shift)
