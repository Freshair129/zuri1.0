# ADR-067: Changelog System v2 — Sliding Window with Orchestrator

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

---

## Context

ZURI-v1 had no consistent changelog. Changes were tracked only through commit messages, which are:

- Granular (one commit per small task)
- Inconsistent in format and detail
- Not readable by non-technical stakeholders (Boss)
- Not useful for AI agents trying to understand what changed since the last session

Three distinct audiences need a changelog:

1. **Boss** — needs a concise, human-readable summary of what changed between sessions or deployments
2. **AI agents (Claude Code)** — needs recent context at session start to avoid re-doing completed work or asking redundant questions
3. **Team handoff** — needs a record of what was done and why, especially for async collaboration

`CHANGELOG.md` at the project root was created (`?? CHANGELOG.md` in git status) but has no enforced format or maintenance process. Without a defined system, it will either grow unbounded or fall out of date.

## Decision

- **`CHANGELOG.md` at project root** — the active changelog, maintained as a sliding window
- **Sliding window: keep the last 10 versions** — older entries are archived, not deleted
- **Version scheme: semver-like `v2.X.Y`**
  - `v2.X.0` — minor release (new feature or module)
  - `v2.X.Y` — patch release (fix, refactor, config change)
  - Major version bump (`v3.0.0`) reserved for breaking architecture changes (new ADR required)
- **Current version: v2.3.0**
- **LATEST pointer** at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` for quick reference
- **Archive location:** `docs/changelog/v{X.Y.Z}.md` — one file per version, never deleted
- **Orchestrator command:** `npx zuri changelog "v2.4.0" "Add kitchen stock deduction"` → generates a draft entry from git diff and staged changes
- **Session discipline:** each Claude Code session should end with a CHANGELOG entry, enforced by the `/checkpoint` slash command

### Entry Format

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
- description

### Changed
- description

### Fixed
- description

### Notes
- context
```

### CHANGELOG.md Structure

```
# CHANGELOG

> LATEST: v2.3.0 (2026-03-30)

## [2.3.0] 2026-03-30
...

## [2.2.1] 2026-03-15
...

(up to 10 versions total — older versions archived to docs/changelog/)
```

### Archival Process

When the 11th version is added, the oldest entry in `CHANGELOG.md` is moved to `docs/changelog/v{X.Y.Z}.md` and replaced with a reference link. The orchestrator `changelog.js` command handles this automatically.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Git tags only** — machine-readable but no human-readable summary. Boss cannot read `git log`. Rejected.
2. **Auto-generate from commit messages** — too noisy; commits are granular (e.g., "fix lint", "rename variable"). A useful changelog requires intentional summarization. Rejected.
3. **Notion or external tool** — breaks the SSOT principle (docs live in `docs/`, accessible via Obsidian MCP). Adds a dependency outside the repo. Rejected.
4. **Keep-a-changelog format without sliding window** — `CHANGELOG.md` grows indefinitely; after 6 months it becomes unwieldy for AI agents to parse. Rejected in favor of sliding window + archive.
5. **One CHANGELOG.md with all history** — simpler, but the file would exceed AI agent context limits over time. Sliding window is the right tradeoff.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Boss always has a readable summary of what changed
- AI agents read `CHANGELOG.md` at session start to recover context quickly (supports `catchup` and `checkpoint` commands)
- Archive in `docs/changelog/` preserves full history without polluting the active file
- Orchestrator integration reduces manual effort — `npx zuri changelog` drafts the entry
- `/checkpoint` command enforces the update habit at session end

### Negative

- Requires manual discipline to write meaningful entries (orchestrator helps but cannot fully auto-generate)
- Adds a small overhead to each session (acceptable: < 2 minutes with orchestrator)
- Archive files in `docs/changelog/` add minor file count to the repo

### Risks

- **Changelog falls behind** — mitigated by `/checkpoint` command, which makes the update a required step of session close
- **Entries are too vague** (e.g., "misc fixes") — mitigated by the structured `Added / Changed / Fixed / Notes` format and orchestrator diff context
- **Version numbers drift out of sync** — mitigated by the orchestrator command prompting for a version bump suggestion based on change type

## Implementation Notes

- **Active file:** `CHANGELOG.md` (project root)
- **Archive directory:** `docs/changelog/` — create if it does not exist
- **Archive file naming:** `docs/changelog/v{X.Y.Z}.md`
- **Orchestrator command:** `.dev/orchestrator/commands/changelog.js`
  - Accepts version string and summary as arguments
  - Reads `git diff HEAD` to draft section content
  - Prepends new entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Updates LATEST pointer
  - Archives oldest entry if version count exceeds 10
- **`/checkpoint` slash command** — calls `changelog.js` as part of session save sequence (see `.dev/shared-context/commands/checkpoint.md`)
- **`/catchup` slash command** — reads `CHANGELOG.md` LATEST entry to restore recent context at session start
