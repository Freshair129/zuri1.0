# ADR-061: Split Prisma Schema with prisma-merge

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

---

## Context

ZURI-v1 has a single `prisma/schema.prisma` file containing **81 models** at **95KB**:

- The file is unreadable as a whole — no developer (or AI agent) can hold it in context
- Any PR that touches the schema produces a diff that is impossible to review meaningfully
- Multiple agents working in parallel on different modules (CRM, POS, Marketing) must all edit the same file — merge conflicts are inevitable
- The marketing module alone contains ~14 ad-metric models; culinary has ~20 models — these have no business being in the same file as `auth` session tables
- Prisma OSS does not natively support multiple schema files as of the current stable release (multi-schema RFC is not production-ready)

This decision is a dependency of ADR-060 (Modular Architecture): once modules own their folders, they should also own their schema definitions.

## Decision

Split `prisma/schema.prisma` into per-module `.prisma` files, each co-located with its owning module. Use the `prisma-merge` CLI tool to combine them into a single `schema.prisma` at build time.

**Canonical split:**

| File | Models owned |
|---|---|
| `prisma/base.prisma` | `datasource db`, `generator client`, all shared `enum` definitions |
| `src/modules/core/auth/schema.prisma` | `User`, `Session`, `Account`, `VerificationToken` |
| `src/modules/core/crm/schema.prisma` | `Customer`, `CustomerProfile`, `CrmMember` |
| `src/modules/core/inbox/schema.prisma` | `Conversation`, `Message`, `ConversationIntelligence` |
| `src/modules/core/pos/schema.prisma` | `Order`, `CartItem`, `Transaction`, `CreditNote`, `Advance`, `PosPointTransaction` |
| `src/modules/core/marketing/schema.prisma` | `Campaign`, `Ad`, `AdSet`, and all ~14 ad-metric models |
| `src/modules/core/dsb/schema.prisma` | `ConversationAnalysis`, `DailyBrief` |
| `src/modules/core/tasks/schema.prisma` | `Task`, `TaskComment` |
| `src/modules/core/notifications/schema.prisma` | `Notification`, `NotificationTemplate` |
| `src/modules/shared/procurement/schema.prisma` | `PurchaseOrder`, `Supplier`, `PurchaseItem` |
| `src/modules/shared/inventory/schema.prisma` | `InventoryItem`, `StockMovement`, `InventoryAlert` |
| `src/modules/shared/audit/schema.prisma` | `AuditLog` |
| `src/modules/industry/culinary/schema.prisma` | All ~20 culinary models: `Recipe`, `Ingredient`, `CourseMenu`, `Enrollment`, `KitchenOrder`, `Certificate`, etc. |

**Merge step — `prisma/schema.prisma` becomes a generated file:**

```json
// package.json scripts
{
  "scripts": {
    "prisma:merge":    "prisma-merge --output prisma/schema.prisma",
    "prisma:generate": "npm run prisma:merge && prisma generate",
    "prisma:migrate":  "npm run prisma:merge && prisma migrate dev",
    "build":           "npm run prisma:generate && next build"
  }
}
```

`prisma/schema.prisma` is committed to the repo (Prisma tooling requires it) but marked as generated in comments — developers must not edit it directly.

**Cross-module relations:**

When a model in one module references a model in another (e.g., `Message.conversationId → Conversation.id`), the FK field and `@relation` stay in the file that owns the child model (`inbox/schema.prisma` owns both in this case). For true cross-module FKs (e.g., `Order.customerId → Customer.id`), the FK lives in the child model's file and references the parent by model name — `prisma-merge` resolves this correctly since all files are merged before `prisma generate` runs.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|
| **Keep single `schema.prisma`** | Maintains current pain: 95KB unreadable file, serial editing bottleneck, no module ownership. Rejected. |
| **Prisma multi-schema RFC** (`previewFeature: "multiSchema"`) | Maps models to multiple DB schemas (PostgreSQL schemas), not multiple source files. Solves a different problem, adds operational complexity (cross-schema joins, migrations), and is not stable. |
| **Separate databases per module** | Would require cross-DB joins via application layer, breaking the repository pattern. Incompatible with multi-tenant `tenant_id` isolation (ADR-056). Overkill for current scale. |
| **Manual file concatenation in CI** | Fragile, hard to maintain ordering, no validation. `prisma-merge` is purpose-built and handles relation resolution. |

## Consequences

### Positive

- Each module owns its models — a PR touching `src/modules/core/pos/schema.prisma` is reviewable and scoped
- Agents and developers can be assigned a module without needing to understand the full 81-model schema
- Parallel editing is safe — no merge conflicts between unrelated modules
- `prisma/schema.prisma` regenerates cleanly from source-of-truth module files
- Enforces the module ownership principle from ADR-060

### Negative

- `prisma-merge` adds a required build step — `prisma generate` and `prisma migrate` must always be preceded by the merge; running them directly on a partial schema will fail
- Developers must remember to edit the module `.prisma` file, not the generated `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Cross-module FK relations require careful attention to which file owns the `@relation` directive
- `prisma-merge` is a third-party tool — must pin the version and verify it supports the Prisma version in use

### Risks

- **Merge ordering issues:** If two module schemas define a relation to the same model and `prisma-merge` processes them out of order, the generated schema may be invalid. Mitigation: add a post-merge validation step (`prisma validate`) in CI before any migration runs.
- **Developer bypasses merge:** A developer edits `prisma/schema.prisma` directly and then runs `prisma:merge`, overwriting their changes. Mitigation: add a `# GENERATED FILE — DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY` header and a pre-commit hook that checks the file hash.
- **prisma-merge version skew:** An upgrade to Prisma may break `prisma-merge` compatibility. Mitigation: pin both in `package.json` and test together before upgrading either.

## Implementation Notes

**Step 1 — Install prisma-merge:**

```bash
npm install --save-dev prisma-merge
```

Configure `prisma-merge.config.js` at project root:

```js
// prisma-merge.config.js
module.exports = {
  input: [
    'prisma/base.prisma',
    'src/modules/**/*.prisma',
  ],
  output: 'prisma/schema.prisma',
}
```

**Step 2 — Create `prisma/base.prisma`:**

Move `datasource db`, `generator client`, and all top-level `enum` blocks out of `schema.prisma` into `prisma/base.prisma`. Leave `schema.prisma` as a generated artifact.

**Step 3 — Split models incrementally (matches ADR-060 migration phases):**

Do not split all 81 models at once. Split per module as that module is migrated:

1. Start with `industry/culinary/schema.prisma` — largest isolated group (~20 models)
2. `core/marketing/schema.prisma` — second largest isolated group (~14 models)
3. Continue per ADR-060 module migration order

After each split, run:

```bash
npm run prisma:generate  # merge + generate
npx prisma validate      # catch relation errors immediately
```

**Step 4 — CI enforcement:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml (or Vercel build config)
- name: Validate Prisma schema
  run: |
    npm run prisma:merge
    npx prisma validate
    git diff --exit-code prisma/schema.prisma  # fail if generated file is stale
```

**Key file paths:**

- `prisma/base.prisma` — datasource, generator, enums (hand-edited)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — generated output (do not edit)
- `prisma-merge.config.js` — merge configuration
- `src/modules/*/schema.prisma` — module-owned model definitions
- `src/lib/db.ts` — unchanged; imports from generated `@prisma/client`
