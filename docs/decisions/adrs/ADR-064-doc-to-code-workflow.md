# ADR-064: DOC TO CODE Workflow — Mandatory Documentation Before Implementation

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

---

## Context

ZURI-v1 had no formal spec process — features were built ad-hoc, leading to:

- **Inconsistent behavior across modules:** Without a shared spec, the same concept (e.g., "enrollment status") was implemented differently in CRM, Kitchen, and Reporting
- **AI agent hallucination:** Claude Code and other agents implemented flows based on inferred requirements rather than approved specs, producing code that was technically correct but functionally wrong
- **6 production incidents** traced back to missing or stale specs — no authoritative source of truth for what a feature was supposed to do
- **No audit trail:** No record of why decisions were made, making debugging and onboarding extremely slow

With AI agents (Claude Code) now doing significant coding, the risk of building the wrong thing increases substantially. Agents are fast, which means wrong decisions compound quickly. The Boss is the sole product owner and must have an approval checkpoint before any code is written.

The Obsidian vault (`docs/`) is the designated SSOT for all product and architecture documentation (ADR-062). The DOC TO CODE rule formalizes how that vault is used to gate implementation.

## Decision

**No implementation without an approved spec + ADR.**

A mandatory three-phase workflow gates all feature work:

### Phase 1 — SPEC

1. Agent or developer creates `docs/product/specs/FEAT-{NAME}.md` from the standard template
2. Spec must include: problem statement, user stories, data flow, API endpoints, DB models, RBAC roles, edge cases
3. Boss reviews → sets status to `APPROVED`
4. Only APPROVED specs may proceed to Phase 2

### Phase 2 — ARCHITECTURE (if needed)

1. If the feature requires a new architectural decision (new external service, schema shape, caching strategy, etc.), write `docs/decisions/adrs/ADR-{NNN}-{slug}.md`
2. Boss reviews → approves ADR
3. ADR is not required for purely UI features with no architectural impact

### Phase 3 — IMPLEMENT

1. Claude Code (or developer) codes strictly against the approved spec
2. On completion, add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under the current date
3. Boss verifies behavior against spec acceptance criteria

### Spec Status Lifecycle

```
DRAFT → REVIEW → APPROVED → IMPLEMENTED
```

- `DRAFT`: Spec created, not yet submitted for review
- `REVIEW`: Submitted to Boss — no coding may start
- `APPROVED`: Boss approved — coding may proceed
- `IMPLEMENTED`: Feature shipped and verified

### Orchestrator CLI Enforcement

- `npx zuri new-feature` — creates a new FEAT-*.md from the standard template
- `npx zuri verify-flow` — checks spec completeness: data flow defined, API endpoints listed, roles specified, all referenced models exist in `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `npx zuri pre-commit` — blocks commits to `src/app/api/` routes if no corresponding APPROVED spec exists in `docs/product/specs/`

### Agent Protocol Rule

Claude must query `docs/product/specs/` and confirm APPROVED status before writing any implementation code. If a spec does not exist or is not APPROVED, Claude must stop and request one.

This rule is recorded in `CLAUDE.md`:

> DOC TO CODE: Never implement without approved spec + ADR. Check `docs/product/specs/` for APPROVED specs before coding.

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|
| **No process (ZURI-v1 approach)** | Directly caused 6 production incidents. AI agents compound the problem — fast implementation of wrong requirements. |
| **Jira/Linear tickets only** | Tickets are too shallow for AI agents to derive correct implementation. No structured data flow, no role mapping, no edge cases. Agents cannot reliably read ticket prose. |
| **RFC process** | Too heavyweight for a 1-person team plus AI. RFC requires socialization, comment periods, and consensus building. Overkill when approval chain is a single person (Boss). |
| **Spec required but no tooling enforcement** | Relies on discipline alone. Pre-commit hook and `verify-flow` CLI make the rule automatic rather than honorary. |

## Consequences

### Positive

- AI agents build the right thing — spec is the unambiguous source of truth
- Boss has a clear approval checkpoint before any code is written
- Full audit trail: every feature links back to a spec and (if applicable) an ADR
- Prevents rework — the most expensive phase to fix a wrong decision is post-implementation
- Spec doubles as onboarding documentation for future team members
- `verify-flow` CLI catches incomplete specs before Boss review, reducing review round-trips

### Negative

- Slower to start coding — spec writing takes time, especially for complex features
- Requires discipline to keep spec status up to date as implementation progresses
- Boss becomes a review bottleneck if many features are in REVIEW simultaneously

### Risks

- **Over-documentation:** Specs become long and bureaucratic, slowing the team. Mitigation: specs are intentionally short (1-2 pages max); the template enforces focus on data flow and roles, not prose.
- **Boss bottleneck:** If Boss is unavailable, REVIEW specs block all coding. Mitigation: async review — Boss can approve via Obsidian comment or message; agents can work on APPROVED specs in parallel.
- **Spec drift:** Approved spec becomes stale as implementation reveals edge cases. Mitigation: Claude must update the spec in place (not create a new one) and flag material changes for re-approval.

## Implementation Notes

**Spec template location:** `docs/product/specs/_TEMPLATE.md`

**Spec file naming convention:** `FEAT-{SCREAMING-KEBAB}.md` (e.g., `FEAT-SLIP-OCR.md`, `FEAT-ENROLLMENT-FLOW.md`)

**Orchestrator commands:**

```
.dev/orchestrator/commands/
  new-feature.js      # scaffold FEAT-*.md from template
  verify-flow.js      # lint spec completeness + schema cross-check
  pre-commit.js       # block commits to api/ without APPROVED spec
```

**CLAUDE.md rule (already in place):**

```
DOC TO CODE: Never implement without approved spec + ADR.
Check docs/product/specs/ for APPROVED specs before coding.
```

**Agent behavior (AGENT_PROTOCOL.md):**

Before implementing any feature, Claude must:

1. Run: check `docs/product/specs/FEAT-{NAME}.md` exists and status is `APPROVED`
2. Run: check any referenced ADRs are approved
3. Only then proceed to write code
