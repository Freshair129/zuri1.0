# ADR-063: Dev Tools Isolation — .dev/ Directory

**Status:** PROPOSED
**Date:** 2026-03-30
**Author:** Claude (Architect)
**Approver:** Boss

---

## Context

ZURI-v1 mixes development tooling with production application code at the repository root. Files that should never run in production are currently co-located with Next.js source:

- `.agent/` — agent protocol configs
- `.claude/skills/` — Claude Code slash command skills
- `scripts/` — one-off backfill and migration helpers (some contain DB connection strings)
- `fix_*.js`, `git_push*.js` — ad-hoc maintenance scripts
- Orchestrator CLI, vibecode multi-agent config — dev-only orchestration tools

**Problems this causes:**

1. **Bundle bloat:** Vercel includes these files in the build context. Non-JS files are ignored at runtime, but they inflate upload size and scan time.
2. **Security surface:** Scripts with DB connection strings or API keys (even templated ones) are included in the artifact Vercel processes. A misconfigured `.vercelignore` could expose them.
3. **Cognitive overhead:** A developer running `ls` at root cannot distinguish "this runs in prod" from "this is a dev tool." The signal-to-noise ratio is poor.
4. **No clear ownership:** Dev tools have no home, so they accumulate wherever is convenient.

The project now uses a multi-agent setup (orchestrator CLI, vibecode agents, Claude sub-agents). These components will grow. Without a structural boundary, the root will become increasingly cluttered.

## Decision

All developer tooling that is **never needed at runtime in production** is moved to `.dev/` at the repository root.

**Deployment boundary:**
- `.dev/` is listed in `.vercelignore` — it never deploys to Vercel
- `.dev/` is tracked in git — it is pushed to GitHub so the whole team shares the same tools

**Canonical `.dev/` structure:**

```
.dev/
├── orchestrator/          # CLI tool: new-feature, new-adr, new-spec, etc.
├── agents/                # Agent protocol (AGENT_PROTOCOL.md), Claude skills, sub-agent definitions
├── vibecode/              # Multi-agent config: agents.yaml, router.yaml, gates.yaml
├── scripts/               # One-off scripts: backfill/, migration-helpers/, seed/
└── shared-context/        # GOAL.md, MEMORY.md, CONTEXT_INDEX.yaml
```

**Files that stay at root (not moved to `.dev/`):**

| File/Dir | Reason stays at root |
|---|---|
| `.claude/commands/` | Claude Code requirement — CLI only discovers slash commands here |
| `docs/` | Obsidian vault (ADR-062) — also excluded from Vercel via `.vercelignore` |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Auto-loaded by Claude Code on session start — must be at root |
| `prisma/` | Prisma CLI expects `prisma/schema.prisma` at root by default |
| `.env`, `.env.local` | Standard Next.js/Vercel convention |

## Alternatives Considered

| Option | Reason Rejected |
|---|---|
| **Keep everything at root** (status quo) | Does not solve bundle bloat, security surface, or cognitive overhead |
| **Separate `dev-tools` repository** | Dev tools lose proximity to the code they operate on; harder to keep in sync; two repos to clone |
| **Git submodule for dev tools** | Complexity disproportionate to the benefit; submodule state is a common source of confusion |
| **`scripts/` only (no `.dev/`)** | Addresses scripts but not orchestrator, agent configs, or vibecode — partial solution |
| **`.github/` for everything** | `.github/` has semantic meaning (Actions, templates); mixing dev tools there is misleading |

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Clean production artifact:** Vercel build context contains only application code
- **Clear boundary:** Any file under `.dev/` is definitionally dev-only — no ambiguity
- **Versioned with code:** Dev tools evolve alongside the features they support; no drift between repo and tooling
- **Security improvement:** Scripts with connection strings stay out of the Vercel artifact (assuming `.vercelignore` is correct)
- **Scalable:** New dev tools, agents, or scripts have a well-known home

### Negative

- **One extra directory level:** Paths like `.dev/orchestrator/new-adr.js` are longer than `scripts/new-adr.js`
- **`.dev/` is hidden by default:** Some editors hide dotfiles; team members must configure their editor to show it
- **Migration work:** Existing scripts and agent configs must be moved and any references updated

### Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| `.vercelignore` missing `.dev/` entry | Low | Add entry on day one; add a pre-deploy check in CI |
| `.env` files committed inside `.dev/scripts/` | Medium | `.gitignore` must include `.dev/**/.env` and `.dev/**/.env.local`; document in `CLAUDE.md` |
| Team forgets the boundary, adds scripts to root | Medium | Code review checklist; `CLAUDE.md` documents the rule |

## Implementation Notes

**`.vercelignore` entries to add:**

```
.dev/
docs/
changelog/
*.yaml
*.md
!CLAUDE.md
```

Note: `!CLAUDE.md` exempts the root `CLAUDE.md` from the `*.md` exclusion so it remains accessible if Vercel ever needs to read it (belt-and-suspenders).

**`.gitignore` — confirm these are present and `.dev/` is NOT listed:**

```
node_modules/
.next/
.env
.env.local
.vercel/
# .dev/ is intentionally tracked
```

**`.gitignore` additions for secrets inside `.dev/`:**

```
.dev/**/.env
.dev/**/.env.local
.dev/**/credentials*.json
```

**Migration checklist:**

1. Create `.dev/` directory structure
2. Move `.agent/` → `.dev/agents/`
3. Move vibecode config files → `.dev/vibecode/`
4. Move orchestrator CLI → `.dev/orchestrator/`
5. Move `scripts/` contents → `.dev/scripts/`
6. Move `shared-context/` (currently `.dev/shared-context/` per git status — already done) — confirm location
7. Update any absolute paths in orchestrator scripts
8. Add `.vercelignore` entries
9. Verify `git status` shows `.dev/` tracked, not ignored
10. Update `CLAUDE.md` File Reference section
