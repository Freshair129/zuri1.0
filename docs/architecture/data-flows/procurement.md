# Data Flow — Procurement (Shared Module)

The Procurement module manages the full lifecycle of purchasing inventory, from Request to Goods Received Note (GRN).

---

## 1. Write Flows

### 1.1 Purchase Order Lifecycle

Used when buying ingredients from suppliers.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as POManagement
    participant API as POST /api/procurement/po
    participant Repo as poRepo
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    UI->>API: POST /api/procurement/po {supplierId, items[], total}
    API->>Repo: createPO(tenantId, data)
    Repo->>DB: INSERT PurchaseOrders {status: DRAFT, tenant_id}
    Repo->>DB: INSERT PurchaseOrderItems {poId, itemId, qty, price}
    DB-->>Repo: COMMIT
    Repo-->>API: 201 PurchaseOrder
    API-->>UI: 201 PurchaseOrder

    Note over UI,API: Status: DRAFT → PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED → SHIPPED → RECEIVED
```

### 1.2 Goods Received Note (GRN)

Linking Procurement back to Inventory when items arrive at the warehouse.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as GRNForm
    participant API as POST /api/procurement/po/[id]/receive
    participant PoRepo as poRepo
    participant InvRepo as inventoryRepo
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant Redis as Upstash Redis

    UI->>API: POST /api/procurement/po/[id]/receive {itemsReceived[]}
    API->>PoRepo: receivePO(tenantId, id, itemsReceived)
    API->>InvRepo: receiveStock(tenantId, {itemsReceived, ref: poId})
    PoRepo->>DB: prisma.$transaction([ <br/>  UPDATE PurchaseOrders SET status: RECEIVED, <br/>  INSERT IngredientLots (batch receive), <br/>  UPDATE Ingredient currentStock <br/> ])
    DB-->>PoRepo: COMMIT
    PoRepo-->>API: 200 ReceivedOK
    API->>Redis: DEL inventory:stock-list:{tenantId}
    API-->>UI: 200 Success
```

## 2. Read Flows

### 2.1 Supplier List & Performance

Used when choosing a supplier for a new PO.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant UI as SupplierPage
    participant API as GET /api/procurement/suppliers
    participant SupplierRepo as supplierRepo
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    UI->>API: GET /api/procurement/suppliers
    API->>SupplierRepo: list(tenantId)
    SupplierRepo->>DB: SELECT * FROM suppliers WHERE tenant_id = ?
    DB-->>SupplierRepo: rows[]
    SupplierRepo-->>API: suppliers[]
    API-->>UI: 200 suppliers[]
```

---

## 3. Realtime Flows

| Event | Channel | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `po-approved` | `private-tenant-{tenantId}` | After PO state change to APPROVED |
| `po-received` | `private-tenant-{tenantId}` | After GRN completion |

---

## 4. Cache Strategy

| Cache Key | TTL | Invalidation |
|---|---|---|
| `procurement:suppliers:{tenantId}` | 300s | Any supplier update |
| `procurement:po:{tenantId}:{id}` | 60s | Any PO state change |

---

## 5. Security & Isolation

- **Approval Workflow:** POs above a certain threshold (config: `procurement.limit`) MUST be approved by `OWNER` or `MANAGER`.
- **Tenant Isolation:** Every PO and supplier linked to `tenant_id`.
- **Audit:** Every status change in the PO lifecycle is logged in `AuditLog`.
